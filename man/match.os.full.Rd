\title{Optimal full matching.}
\usage{
match.os.full(z,dist,dat,ncontrol.min=0,ncontrol.max=Inf,exact=NULL,solver='')
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{ A vector whose ith coordinate is 1 for a treated unit and is 0 for a control.}
\item{dist}{ A distance matrix where each treated unit has a row and each control unit has a column.}
\item{dat}{ A data frame with length(z) rows.  If the match is feasible, the matched portion of dat is returned with additional columns that define the match.}
\item{ncontrol.min}{ The minimum ratio of controls to treatments that is to be permitted within a matched set.}
\item{ncontrol.max}{ The maximum ratio of controls to treatments that is to be permitted within a matched set.}
\item{exact}{ If not NULL, then a vector of length(z)=length(p) giving variable that need to be exactly matched. }
\item{solver}{ Solver to for the minimum cost network flow problem to find the optimal match. The default solver uses RELAX-IV if rrelaxiv is installed and uses LEMON otherwise.}
}

\value{
A list of results is returned.

\item{data}{ The matched sample, selected rows of dat.}
\item{structure}{ The structure of the match.}
\item{effsize}{ The effective sample size of the match.}
}

\description{
The program finds an optimal full match,  incorporating restrictions on matched setsâ€™ ratios of treatment to control units.
}


\details{
The match minimizes the total distance between treated subjects and their matched controls. 

You MUST install and load the optmatch package to use match.os.full().
